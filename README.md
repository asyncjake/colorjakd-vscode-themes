# colorjakd / jakethedev's theme pack

### (screenshots coming soon)

Custom themes or forks of colorful themes I like but wanted to tweak for some reason. The core motivation for this is a single pack of themes I actually like looking at for 123908 hours a day with love for the light themers out there. All sources cited because humanity works better together

When I say 'forks', I mean I love the theme but I don't want to have to sort through tons of themes I don't like because I'm way too picky and way too lazy. Naturally then, I followed 'the process' (gist or blog coming soon) to take an existing theme and export it from VSCode, set up a VSCode extension project to test it live, copy the exported theme into the new project, adjust to taste, then save/commit as a new theme in this repo. So it's not a fork in the traditional sense, but that's the intent

If anyone I 'forked' a theme from is bothered by this (or if I broke a license on accident), just file a new issue on this repo to have it removed, and I'm happy to oblige for anyone that clearly owns a 'forked' theme

## Light Themes

#### `jakd / violet ice`

My very first theme from scratch, nice. Fully organic made mostly with `https://themes.vscode.one` then adjusted a bit at a time for better usability and stuff. Initially inspired by Arturia hardware then infused with sick colors, this theme is primarily white and violet with a slap of teal and a dash of gold for balance

Here's the thing: picking a light theme shouldn't mean you have to deal with washed out colors, so I fixed it. Dope. Probably more to come but this might be my first and last, I like it a lot

## Dark Themes

### `jakd / andromeda` (fork of Andromeda Bordered from `EliverLara.andromeda`)

### `jakd / hacker` (forked from `chausen.hacker-blue`)

### `jakd / batman` (forked from `Vaporizer.vaporizer-dark`)

### `jakd / cyber` (forked from `Vaporizer.vaporizer-dark`)

### `jakd / painting2` (forked from `Vaporizer.vaporizer-dark`)
