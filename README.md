# colorjakd / jakethedev's theme pack

### (screenshots coming soon)

Custom themes or forks of colorful themes I like but wanted to tweak for some reason. The core motivation for this is a single pack of themes I actually like looking at for 123908 hours a day with love for the light themers out there. All sources cited because humanity works better together

When I say 'forks', I mean I love the theme but I don't want to have to sort through tons of themes I don't like because I'm way too picky and way too lazy. Naturally then, I followed 'the process' (gist or blog coming soon) to take an existing theme and export it from VSCode, set up a VSCode extension project to test it live, copy the exported theme into the new project, adjust to taste, then save/commit as a new theme in this repo. So it's not a fork in the traditional sense, but that's the intent

If anyone I 'forked' a theme from is bothered by this (or if I broke a license on accident), just file a new issue on this repo to have it removed, and I'm happy to oblige for anyone that clearly owns a 'forked' theme

## Light Themes

### `jakd / violet ice`

My very first theme from scratch, this is my daytime default. Fully organic and fair trade with roundup and pesticides provided by `https://themes.vscode.one` then biohacked for better usability and stuff. Initially inspired by Arturia hardware then infused with sick colors, this theme is primarily white and violet with a slap of teal and a sprinkle of gold for balance

I am just so sick of light themes having washed out colors or a dire lack of vibe, so I fixed it. Dope. I'd like to make more but this might be my last, I like it a lot

## Dark Themes

### `jakd / andromeda` (forked from `EliverLara.andromeda`)

### `jakd / hacker` (forked from `chausen.hacker-blue`)

### `jakd / batman` (forked from `Vaporizer.vaporizer-dark`)

### `jakd / cyber` (forked from `Vaporizer.vaporizer-dark`)

### `jakd / painting2` (forked from `Vaporizer.vaporizer-dark`)

## License

### TLDR: This is all MIT except hacker-blue, which is unknown but reposted in good faith that lennythetechie wanted these colors out in the world

All custom themes are released under the MIT license, pay it forward :)

`andromeda` is from `EliverLara.andromeda` on the VSCode marketplace with a public repository - so this is customized and republished with permission provided by the [MIT license](https://github.com/EliverLara/Andromeda/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

`batman`, `cyber`, and `painting2` are all from the `Vaporizer.vaporizer-dark` theme pack on the VSCode marketplace. Per the marketplace license link, these are customized and republished with permission provided by the [MIT License](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/Vaporizer.vaporizer-dark/license)

`hacker` may be removed at any point, license information is unknown. The original theme was created by [lennythetechie on themes.vscode.one](https://themes.vscode.one/theme/lennythetechie/o8CSDFWb), but lenny doesn't seem to be on github. Lenny's theme was eventually found by a github user named chausen, but the theme wasn't published as an installable extension anywhere - so chausen pulled it into [their own github repo](https://github.com/chausen/hacker-blue) and published it. No license information is available in either location
- At the time of acquisition (and also writing this), themes.vscode.one's host (currently flamelab.io) has terms of service stating that users who upload/create content on their platform are responsible for enforcing their own copyright
- TLDR Lenny hit me up I want to give you credit your theme is dope
