# colorjakd / jakethedev's theme pack

Custom themes or forks of colorful themes I like but wanted to tweak for some reason. The core motivation for this is a single pack of themes I actually like looking at for 123908 hours a day with love for the light themers out there. All sources cited because humanity works better together

## Light Themes

#### Violet Ice Light Theme (custom)

My very first theme from scratch, nice. Fully organic made mostly with `https://themes.vscode.one` then adjusted a bit at a time for better usability and stuff. Initially inspired by Arturia hardware then infused with sick colors, this theme is primarily white and violet with a slap of teal and a dash of gold for balance

Here's the thing: picking a light theme shouldn't mean you have to deal with washed out colors, so I fixed it. Dope. Probably more to come but this might be my first and last, I like it a lot

## Dark Themes

#### Andromeda Bordered 1.1 (fork of Andromeda Bordered from `EliverLara.andromeda`)

Will likely capture screenshots when this is ready for publishings
